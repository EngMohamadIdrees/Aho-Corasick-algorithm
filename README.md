# Aho-Corasick-algorithm
Program that does the following:
* Create a function that constructs the failure links trie of a given set of pattens.
* Create a function that searches for occurrences of all these patterns (exact matching) within another text string using Aho-Corasick algorithm. Use the failure links trie of the above function.
* Test the function in main() on the example in lecture and make sure it outputs the exact (ti, pj) and Rep(). Let the function output all these information.
* comments explaining the code before each code line, the test case, and following the CodingStyle.pdf file.
